## üìñ Overview

This repo serves as a sandbox and learning resource, containing many isolated React projects to explore:

* React state and lifecycle
* React Router for navigation
* Context API for state sharing
* Redux for global state management
* UI interaction demos (background color change, currency changer)
* Persistence using Local Storage

Each project is self-contained with its own `package.json` (if applicable) and can be run individually.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Each Project

1. Navigate into the folder of the project you want to run, e.g.:

   ```bash
   cd Local_sto
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (default React dev server)

Repeat this for any other project folder you want to explore.

---

## üìù Notes

* `node_modules` is included here but typically should be ignored in `.gitignore` to reduce repo size.
* `MegaPro.zip` contains a zipped archive of the `MegaPro` project for easy sharing.
* `React Notes.docx` contains notes for your reference.
* Each project folder may have its own README or comments for specific instructions.
